# [Project 1: FinalLists](https://github.com/sammycool04/IST-303-Group5)

FinalLists is a web application that enables users to identify their ideal housing option. Users can generate their personalized housing lists based on their inputed parameters such as
* crime rate risk levels and proximity to area amenities (schools, grocery stores)
* recreation space (hiking and biking trails, parks, etc.) that
coincide with selected rental or sales ranges
*bedroom/bathroom combinations and other housing-related specifications.

# [Project 2: Healthy/Sick Faces Classifier with OpenCV and Neural Network](https://github.com/sammycool04/OpenCV-project)
This is a project that integrates convolutional neural network(CNN), OpenCV, and Flask. I was thinking that it would be so beneficial for people to check their health conveniently even at home; therefore, I created this app, which can give you a predicted health condition statement based on simply how you look. After all, the face can tell you a lot about health. The technical design is below:

* start training the CNN model using healthy and sick faces image data
* run the CNN model, save it inside the JSON file, and integrate with OpenCV using a data model
* use Flask to display the index.html file, which shows user's face health condition
